# project-energy
 This project is for forecasting the load of electricity consumed in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region using various traditional and ML networks such as LSTM, RNN, GRU, among others.
 
# Datasets
It is divided into two primary datasets:
 - Univariate dataset having only the load
 - Multivariate dataset having weather as well as the load
 
# Models
Each of the dataset forecasts using the following methods:
 - Classical Methods: SMA, WMA, CMA, EMA
 - Exponential Methods: SES, DES, TES
 - Machine Learning Models: ARIMA, SARIMAX
 - Deep Learning Models: LSTM, GRU, RNN
