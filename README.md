# project-energy
 This project is for analysing the time-series algorithms via a study of electricity load forecasting on univariate and multivariate datasets in the MM Region using various classical/moving averages (SMA, WMA, CMA, EMA), exponential smoothing methods (SES, DES, TES), statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMAX) & DL models (LSTM, GRU, RNN) for univariate and multivariate datasets using Keras API

 
# Datasets
It is divided into two primary datasets:
 - Univariate dataset having only the load
 - Multivariate dataset having weather (Temperature, Dew Point, Humiditiy, Wind Speed, Pressure) as well as the load
 
# Models
Each of the dataset forecasts using the following methods:
 - Classical Methods: SMA, WMA, CMA, EMA
 - Exponential Methods: SES, DES, TES
 - Deep Learning Models: LSTM, GRU, RNN
 - Statistical Models: ARIMA, SARIMAX
